# SPMinerScript
This is planetary miner for in-game programming in Space Engineers game

It's not working yet.
Now i'm writing class for control and stabilize the ship.

At that moment this class can:

- stabilize the ship perpendicular to the planet's gravity vector
- hover above the ground when it does not receive control commands from the keyboard
